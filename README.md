# Server Side Enterprise Development with Angular
This fast-paced book shows you how to use features of the latest version of Angular to rapidly build progressive web applications that are optimized for search performance. You'll be learning about differences in client and server-side rendering. You'll then explore advanced features, like service workers. By the end of the book, you'll have built a dynamic, single-page web application that behaves like a server-rendered application.

## What you will learn
* Identify what makes an Angular application SEO-friendly
* Generate commands to create components and services
* Distinguish between container and presentational components
* Implement server-side rendering using Angular Universal
* Create a web server using Node.js and Express
* Add dynamic metadata to your web application
* Deploy a server-side rendered app to the cloud
* Implement and configure a service worker using Angular PWA

### Hardware Requirements
For the optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: i3
* Memory: 2 GB RAM
* Hard disk: 10 GB
* An internet connection

### Software Requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows 10
* Node 8.9.0 or higher
* npm 5.5.1 or higher
* Git
* Internet Browser: Google Chrome (latest version)

### Installation
To verify the installed versions, run the `node -v` and `npm -v` commands in a terminal. If you want to install or upgrade to the latest version, please visit https://nodejs.org/.

### Versions
While this course is written for Angular 7, most of the content will work exactly the same with Angular 6. We will do our best to keep the content of this course up to date, and in order to support future versions of Angular, we might add an errata.

### Code Editor
Angular is written in and makes use of TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds types. As a developer, you will get the biggest benefit from TypeScript if you use an editor that has good support for it. There are TypeScript plugins for most editors, but there are two we want to highlight, one free and one commercial option.

Visual Studio Code is a free and open source editor by Microsoft, which is the company behind TypeScript. This alone should give you confidence that the TypeScript support is amazing, which it is. VS Code runs on all major platforms. It can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

WebStorm IDE is a commercial IDE by JetBrains, a company renowned for its solid IDEs. WebStorm also has great built-in support for TypeScript. There is a free community edition available for those who want to try it out at https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/.

### Development API
This course focuses on building an Angular application that functions as a public website. It will retrieve the content from a REST API to match real-life use cases as closely as possible.

### Folder Structure
* The API is available under the `api` folder.
* The code for the theory and exercises is available under the `solution` folder.
* The code for the activities is available under the `solution-extra-activities` folder.
